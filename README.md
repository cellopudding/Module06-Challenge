# Module06-Challenge

## Descripton
In this project, the goal was to create a weather dashboard using that would allow the user to search for a city, see its 5 day forecast, and save their searches to the page for future use. I ran into some issues in constructing this so I'm choosing to turn it in incomplete for now. I struggled with this module and I need to revisit it before I can make this proect complete.
